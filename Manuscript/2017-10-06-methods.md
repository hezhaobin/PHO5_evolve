# Methods

## Reconstructing phylogeny for _PHO5_ gene family in four species

We chose four species, i.e. _S. cerevisiae_, _S. mikatae_, _K. lactis_ and _S. pombe_, which span a wide range of evolutionary distance and all of which have multiple gene members in the _PHO5_ family. To retrieve the protein sequences for paralogs of _PHO5_ in each of the four species, we used the pre-computed "orthogroups" from the Fungal Orthogroups Repository (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/, Wapinski et al. 2007). To validate the gene list, we cross-referenced other For _S. mikatae_, a newer genome assembly became available after the Fungal Orthogroups Repositowe downloaded the fasta file containing annotated gene features from the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genome website (http://www.saccharomycessensustricto.org/current/Smik/Smik.fsa, Scannell et al. 2011). A tBLASTn (v2.2.29) search (`makeblastdb -in Smik.fsa -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl; tblastn -query ScPho5.fa -db Smik.fsa -out test`) yielded three significant hits (Smik_2.233,2.234,2.235). Yeast Gene Order Database (http://ygob.ucd.ie/, Byrne and Wolfe 2005) revealed that the three genes form a tandem cluster in _S. mikatae_ that is syntenic with _ScPHO5_ and _ScPHO3_ in _S. cerevisiae_ (_S. mikatae_ has one more gene in the cluster). For _K. lactis_,
