## Repeated expansion of gene families encoding phosphatases in the Hemiascomycete yeast

The specialization of _CgPMU2_ and _CgPMU3_, i.e. their preferencial response to phosphate vs thiamine starvation, highly resembles that of _ScPHO5_ and _ScPHO3_ in _S. cerevisiae_ (<span font="color:red">ref</span>) and yet, strikingly, the _PHO_ genes and the _PMU_ genes were evolutionarily unrelated. In other words, the gene family expansion and the subsequent transcriptional (Fig. 2) and functional (Fig. 4?) specialization among the phosphatase encoding genes ocurred _independently_ in these two species. This led us to hypothesize that such expansion and subfunctionalization of phosphatase-encoding genes has occurred repeatedly during the evolution of this group of diverse yeasts. 

To test this hypothesis, we initially focused on the _PHO_ gene family and investigated its evolutionary history of gene duplication among a group of eight species spanning a wide range of evolutionary divergence. The hypothesis would be proved if gene duplicaton were to be found to have occurred relatively recently compared to speciation. The relative timing of speciation vs gene duplication can be inferred by comparing the species phylogeny with the protein sequence phylogeny. In a cartoon example with two paralogs in two extant species -- designate the two paralogs as A and B, and the two species as 1 and 2 -- if gene duplication preceded speciation, gene 1A and 2A should coalesce first before they were joined by the cluster of 1B and 2B (Fig. 3A). Conversely, if gene duplication occurred after speciation, 1A and 1B would coalesce first, i.e. the first coalescence event being speciation, and so would 2A and 2B, both before the two clusters would coalesce (Fig. 3B). The maximum likelihood tree for _PHO5_ family genes in these species showed a complex pattern (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, it clearly supported independent origins of the _PHO_ genes in _S. pombe_, _K. lactis_ and the _sensu stricto_ clade that contains _S. cerevisiae_. Within the closely related _sensu stricto_ clade, which was estimated to have speciated in the past ~20 million years, the protein sequence divergence between homologs were low, resulting in low bootstrap support for some of the internal nodes.
