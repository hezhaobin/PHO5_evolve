## Repeated expansion of gene families encoding phosphatases in the Hemiascomycete yeast

The specialization of _CgPMU2_ and _CgPMU3_, i.e. their preferencial response to phosphate vs thiamine starvation, highly resembles that of _ScPHO5_ and _ScPHO3_ in _S. cerevisiae_ ( __ref__ ) and yet, strikingly, the _PHO_ genes and the _PMU_ genes were evolutionarily unrelated. In other words, the gene family expansion and the subsequent specialization among the phosphatase encoding genes ocurred _independently_ in these two species. This led us to investigate whether such repeated expansion and subfunctionalization of phosphatase-encoding genes is a general pattern among a diverse group of yeast species.

To test this hypothesis, we initially focused on the _PHO_ gene family, and examined its history of gene duplication among eight species spanning a wide range of evolutionary divergence ( _S. cerevisiae_ and _S. pombe_ are as divergent from each other as either is from animals, while _S. cerevisiae_, _S. paradoxus_, _S. mikatae_ and _S. bayanus var. uvarum_ have a level of nucleotide divergence similar to that found between birds and humans ). To explain the logic behind the inference, we invoke a simple example with two paralogs in two extant species -- designate the two paralogs as A and B, and the two species as 1 and 2. If gene duplication predated speciation, then gene 1A and 2A should coalesce first before they were joined by the cluster of 1B and 2B (Fig. 3A). Alternatively, if gene duplication occurred after speciation, it must have happened independently in the two species. In this case 1A and 1B would coalesce first and so would 2A and 2B, both before the two clusters would coalesce (Fig. 3B). The maximum likelihood tree for _PHO5_ family genes in these species showed a complex pattern (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, it strongly suggests that the three genes in the distantly related _S. pombe_, the five genes in the more closely related _K. lactis_ all arose independently from the five _PHO_ genes in the _S. cerevisiae_ lineage. Within the most closely related _sensu stricto_ clade, however, the confidence of gene genealogy is
