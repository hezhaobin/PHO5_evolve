## Reviewer's comment

... the authors focus on adaptation but should meanwhile consider and discuss the effects of genetic drift in many cases. Additionally, are there any features implying genomic fragile sites or recombination hotpots in any species that might link to the repeated changes here?

## Notes to Dennis

I found that we used the term "adapt" five times, once in the last sentence of the Abstract, twice in the first paragraph of the Introduction, and twice in the first paragraph of the Discussion. Those in the Introduction don't matter because it was not a direct statement on our work. The other three times were for the same message: the convergent evolution in the _PHO5_ and _PMU_ families suggest common selective pressures for the specialization of the phosphatases against different nutrient starvation conditions.

### Mutation

**Question: could the _PHO5_ genes be located in a particular part of the chromosome that makes them especially prone to gene duplication and loss?**

No. They are not in a subtelomeric region that is known to harbor more structural variation than the core of a chromosome. Moreover, the _PHO5_ homologs in different species often reside in non-syntenic (based on YGOB) regions of their genomes, making it difficult for one to believe a mutational cause for the repeated gene gain and loss.

**Question: could the promoter and protein sequence evolution behind the specialization result from some mutational biases?**

This would require us to identify the exact type of sequence changes that lead to the transcriptional and substrate specialization. Some of our previous work have been on this topic and based on them, we don't see hints that mutational biases (such as expansion or contraction of short repeat sequences in the promoter or in the protein) are responsible for the convergent evolution of specializations.

### Selection

Is the observation compatible with a neutral evolutionary model? One possibility is that the evolutionary
