## NB

- I originally did this analysis in 2017.09 and labeled it as An007 in my experiment-n-analysis tracking sheet.

## Goal

- Update the analysis with new sequences. In particular, _K. lactis_ and _sensu stricto_ group species get an update based on newer genomic sequences than Ilan and Aviv used.

- This time my goal is to produce four numbers for each species: the number of Pho5 / Pmu2 family genes with or w/o signal peptide.

## Notes
