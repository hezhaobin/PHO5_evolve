## Agenda

- Now I understand the reason to include and in fact start the Result section with the RNA-seq experiment -- by looking into genes induced in C. glabrata under thiamine starvation and which have no orthologs or whose orthologs in S. cerevisiae do not respond to the same stress, they homed in onto Pmu2 and Pmu3, two phosphomutases that have been shown in their previous paper to have gained phosphatase ability. This bring up the issue of specialization following duplication between the two, both in terms of substrate specificity as well as transcriptional regulation.

- The above introduction then led to the quest of how common such scenarios are in the evolutionary history of the Hemiascomycetes. This led us to specifically investigate the gene geneaology of the PHO5 family of phosphatases, which are used by the majority of species as their main phosphatases.

- Our phylogenetic analysis showed one major finding:

    > The PHO5 family gene expansion has occurred multiple times independently during the evolutionary history of the genera -- S. pombe, K. lactis and the sensu stricto clade all had multiple paralogs in the PHO5 family, and the inferred gene geneaology based on sequence similarity suggested that in each lineage / clade, the duplication events happened after the speciation events.

- The next two results section were aimed at proving repeated neo-functionalization after gene duplication in the PHO5 and the PMU family. The first section looked into specialization at the level of gene expression. The second looked into substrate specificity.

## Notes

- Agreed that we'll only show the PHO5 family evolution for the phylogenetic analysis. Will word the section to avoid confusion.

- I'll either add an axis to indicate an estimate of divergence time, in the units of mya, or I'll explain in the text that the phylogeny shape itself is sufficient to make the point (duplications happened frequently and for multiple times, even among closely related species).

- I'll incorporate the functional information (biochemical activities) provided in the rest of the paper into the phylogenetic tree.

- I'll write the result section accompanying this figure.

- Plan to work on it this week or the week after next.
