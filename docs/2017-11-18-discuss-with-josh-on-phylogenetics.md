- formal methods to test gene tree and species tree. incomplete lineage sorting,  notung, Dannie Durand (CMU)

    Chuck Davis paper, estimate timing of all duplication events, 

- our initial assessment, i.e. multiple, recent duplications, is probably flawed, as it implies that there is something special about the recent time (in evolution) such that many species would independently duplicate the genes. A more realistic assumption is that gene family amplification and contraction have always been going on. That would explain the more "messy" gene tree pattern I got for all the orthologs in the 16 species.

- psiBLAST, builds position specific substitution matrices based on the initial BLAST, so the results are more specific to the sequences we study.

- better idea is to use PFAM to pull out orthologs in each genome we are interested in, based on structural information
