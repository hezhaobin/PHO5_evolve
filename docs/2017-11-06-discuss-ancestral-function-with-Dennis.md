Of course, no problem. Maybe someone will have a good insight.

 I agree that we should probably explicitly lay this out in a paragraph in the discussion (I will try to do that). Based on literature, PMU1 suppresses a defect in trehalose phosphatase, and so I think it is likely some kind of sugar phosphatase in the cell that all species need. Then in Cg, PMU2/3 formed and likely acquired the ability to cleave TPP, then it duplicated again into PMU2 and PMU3 and PMU2 specialized to be a broad-range phosphatase and PMU3 kept the PMU2/3 function.

  

  PHO is a different story, I believe. I think that the ancestral PHO likely had some TPPase activity and some broad range phosphatase activity. As there was duplication, there was specialization. This is one possibility, and I am working from the S. pombe data that suggests that you can have both activities present at the same time (TPPase and PNPPase activity). However, we don’t really have access to the ancestor, and more work is required to say this definitively.  That’s my best guess right now…

   Subject: ancestral function & regulation

    

    Hi Dennis,

    A quick question first: I'm planning to include some of the phosphatase results in the group meeting I'm about to give in Peter Andolfatto lab at Princeton. let me know if you prefer I don't talk about this before we submit.

    Regarding the paper itself, I found I'm still puzzled with regards to what is the ancestral regulation and function for both the PHO5 and PMU1 families. My impression (really just impression) is that ancestor of PHO5 gene probably encodes a phosphatase, and your results suggest, if I understand correctly, that the ancestor protein probably acts on TPP more than PNPP and alike. How about PMU1? any evidence we have speak about this?
