Dennis explained his understanding / idea about the ancestral function for _PMU1_ and _PHO5_

- Based on literature, PMU1 suppresses a defect in trehalose phosphatase, and so I think it is likely some kind of sugar phosphatase in the cell that all species need. Then in Cg, PMU2/3 formed and likely acquired the ability to cleave TPP, then it duplicated again into PMU2 and PMU3 and PMU2 specialized to be a broad-range phosphatase and PMU3 kept the PMU2/3 function.

- PHO is a different story. the ancestral PHO likely had some TPPase activity and some broad range phosphatase activity. As there was duplication, there was specialization. This is one possibility, and the S. pombe data suggests that you can have both activities present at the same time (TPPase and PNPPase activity). However, we don’t really have access to the ancestor, and more work is required to say this definitively.  That’s my best guess right now
