## Three main stages during the evolution of a duplicated gene

- The three stages are, origin through mutation, a fixation phase when it segregates in the population and a preservation phase when the fixed change is maintained.

- Gene duplication follow the general scheme above with one important **addition**: following the fixation of the duplicated copy, acquisition of differences between the copies can alter the chances of both copies being _preserved_. This phase falls between the fixation and the preservation phase, and is named "fate-determination phase" in this review.

    _Note_ the difference between the fixation and the fate-determination phase is, the first part is the fixation of the duplicated copy, while the second part is the fixation of the mutations that differentiate the two copies.

    One of my misconception is that the acquisition of differences between the two copies began as soon as the new duplicated gene is born, and neofunctionalization / sub-functionalization happens at the same time as the duplicated gene rises in frequency. The problem is, when the chromosome(s) carrying the newborn gene are still segregating in the population, the chance of a fate-determining mutation to occur on the mutant chromosome and sweep through the population at the same time as the duplication itself is fixed, is pretty low. Any new mutation, be it duplication or fate-determining mutations, have to go through an early stochastic phase, during which the most likely outcome is loss by drift. The more likely scenario is that the duplication itself is fixed in the population first, followed by the fate-determination phase, during which mutations in one or both copies occur and some reach fixation.

- The dozen or so models for the evolution and maintenance of gene duplications are classified based on the selective forces at different stages of the life history of the duplication. In particular,

    In the fixation phase (let A-A denote the new mutation, i.e. duplicated genotype, and A the ancestral, single-copy genotype), P[fixation of A-A] depend on the relative strength of selection for the A-A and A genotypes.
        - Models in Category I: duplication is neutral, A-A will be fixed in the population at a probability of 1/2N and the fixation process take on average 4N generations.
        - Models in Category II and III: involves positive selection in the fixation phase, so fixation probability is higher and time to fixation is shorter compared to the neutral scenario.

- Category I

    This category includes the most familiar models like neofunctionalization and sub-functionalization (DDC, EAC). It has the following features:

    - Gene duplication itself is neutral, and is fixed by genetic drift.

    - Since gene duplication gives no advantage, the fate determination phase has to happen rapidly so that the competing pseudogenization process doesn't occur first (selection is relaxed before the preservation stage)

    - The DDC model differs from the neo-functionalization and the EAC models in that positive selection is not involved in the fate-determination phase. Rather, degenerating mutations in each of the two copies result in a scenario where each mutated copy only performs part of the ancestral gene's function, and thus both copies are required, thus selectively maintained.
    
    - During the preservation phase, the molecular evolution in the original copy will be 

	    - the same as pre-duplication under the neo-functionalization model, while that in the duplicated copy will be accelerated under a combination of relaxed constraint and positive selection.
    
	    - accelerated under both DDC and EAC. So does the duplicated copy. The difference between DDC and EAC is that the former is due to relaxed selective constraints while the latter is due to a combination of relaxed selection and positive selection.

- Category II
