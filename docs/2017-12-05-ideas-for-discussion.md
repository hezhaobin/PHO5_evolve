1. Since gene duplication and loss have occurred all along the evolutionary history for the phosphatase families, there is no reason not to believe that specialization following gene duplication may have happened both recently and in the distant past as well. Rather than suggesting some abrupt change in the environment, which would have favored the expansion and specialization of the phosphatase genes, I am in favor of the hypothesis that the benefit of having multiple, specialized phosphatases may either be relatively small or highly dependent on the special environmental conditions, such that contraction of the gene families could happen relatively frequently.

2. What **is** interesting to me is that, while _PHO5_ family is apparently the preferred raw material, when it is not available (lost in _C. glabrata_), evolution could also co-opt a different gene family, which requires more changes to make them fit for the purpose. This highlights the flexibility of evolution, and how the richness of related protein families offer an amazing pool of raw materials for natural selection to act on.

3. The most amazing thing to me is how many changes are required not just to duplicate the phosphatase genes, but also to specialize their functions transcriptionally, post-translationally and functionally, and yet evolution seems to be able to do so multiple times. This makes me wonder, are some of these changes easier to happen through mutations than we intuitively think they are? And are there any particular features in the genome that facilitate such repeated innovation? -- I realize that there are rather raw ideas, and may require substantial effort to put them into the Discussion. However, I just can't help sharing them with you.
