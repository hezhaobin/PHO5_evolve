## Title

Convergent evolution of phosphatase gene families allows for specialization in phosphate and thiamine starvation in multiple yeast species

## Abstract

Gene duplication provides the raw material for evolution, while subsequent changes in gene regulation and function may allow species to adapt to the new environment. Here we report the observation of repeated duplications (and losses) of a histidine phosphatase gene family in a spectrum of *Saccharomycetaceae* yeasts, resulting in multiple phosphatases regulated by different nutrient conditions --- thiamine and phosphate starvation. This specialization occurs both at the level of phosphatase substrate specificity as well as transcriptional regulation. Surprisingly, in one of the species, *Candida glabrata*, the complete loss of this phosphatase family was compensated by the co-option of a different histidine phosphatase family. We functionally demonstrate that members of this family evolved novel enzymatic functions for phosphate and thiamine starvation, and specialized their transcriptional regulation to either nutrient condition. The convergent evolution involving two different families of histidine phosphatases, and the resulting specialization for different nutrients, provides an example of how gene duplication, co-option, and transcriptional and functional specialization together allow species to adapt to their environment with existing genetic materials.
